title: "Selected problems"
---

We selected a few problems, which we think are good training material for programming contests.  Each problem is assigned to some category and also to some level.  We recommend to start with level 1 in order to make sure you know the basic tools. Then continue with level 2, 3 and finally 4.  But you have guessed that, right?


<script src="sorttable.js"></script>

<style>
/* Sortable tables */
table.sortable thead {
    background-color:#eee;
    color:#666666;
    font-weight: bold;
    cursor: default;
}
</style>
